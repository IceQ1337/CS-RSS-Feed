Team Spirit and FaZe Clan needed all three maps to determine a champion in front of an excited, sold-out crowd at the SPD Bank Oriental Sports Center.<br/><br/>Down 12:5 on map 3, FaZe Clan battled back with 6 consecutive round wins—and some incredible clutches along the way—to force round 24. With the bomb planted and down to a 1v1, sh1ro's final kill earned Team Spirit their first Major Championship.<br/><br/>Celebrate Team Spirit's win with the Major Champions Capsule, now available for purchase. The capsule features autographs from Team Spirit in paper, glitter, holo, and gold, and 50% of the proceeds go to the players and organizations.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/3ed2c31143f07013ef30373c1458adc84731c04d.png"/><br/>With Shanghai in the books we look forward to the BLAST.tv Major in Austin, Texas. See you in June 2025!<br/><br/><div class="bbcodes_Header3_2q6Vr BB_Header3">2025 Service Medal</div><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/7f0747f83da9da8ed752f3848e0ab17caf40de9d.png"/><br/>Beginning January 1st, 2025 players can receive the newest Service Medal in-game. <br/><br/>When you reach Global General (Rank 40) you'll have the option to reset your Profile Rank and earn (or upgrade) a 2025 Service Medal.<br/><br/>Good luck and have fun!]]></description>

      <title>Side-stepping Skill</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Counter-Strike is constantly evolving. From art, to maps, to inventive plays, and even player input, the CS community shapes the game. <br/><br/>Scripting and automating player commands has always been contentious, but over the years some forms of scripting (e.g., jump-throws) have gained acceptance, as they enable plays that wouldn't otherwise be possible. In fact, jump-throws became such an important part of the game that we've done the work to make them reliable without any special scripting or binds (i.e., by jumping and quickly throwing a grenade).<br/><br/>Developing one's coordination and reaction time has always been key to mastering Counter-Strike.<br/><br/>Recently, some hardware features have blurred the line between manual input and automation, so we've decided to draw a clear line on what is or isn't acceptable in Counter-Strike.<br/><br/>We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially--exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match.<br/><br/>To prevent accidental infractions, in-game binds that include more than one movement and/or attack actions will no longer work (e.g., null-binds and jump-throw binds).<br/><br/>If you have a keyboard that includes an input-automation feature (e.g., "Snap Tap Mode"), be sure to disable the feature before you join a match in order to avoid any interruption to your matches.<br/>]]></description>
