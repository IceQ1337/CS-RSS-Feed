      <description><![CDATA[Today's update includes a bunch of quality-of-life improvements that touch upon every part of the game, from maps to UI to gameplay. A few highlights are below, but check out the <a class="Focusable" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4202497395513061959?snr=" tabindex="0"><span data-tooltip-text="store.steampowered.com">release notes</span></a> to see what's new!<br/><br/><video autoplay="" height="auto" loop="" playsinline="" poster="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/2723ea38b9ba52592038731f15e5e9ba512be979.png?origin=" width="100%"><source src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/1a9b430c3ae10f5ec94a27d24f87187618d1919a.mp4?origin=" type="video/mp4"/><source src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/758e01194008b2d20797a378de390cdc24305cf9.webm?origin=" type="video/webm"/></video><br/>Lefties rejoice! Players can now redeploy their weapons, swapping between the left and right hand. You can set your preferred handedness in the settings menu and then switch hands temporarily mid-round with a key press (H on US Keyboards by default).<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/897b47892c65929ccd471ccff7d5aa65696eeb6f.png"/><br/>The buy menu has a few new tricks. To help you decide whether to buy or save, the top right of the buy menu now features the minimum amount of money you're guaranteed to have next round (thanks Kadomos). And at the bottom you'll find the new 'Dropped Weapons' panel, where you can see (and directly pick up) any weapons that you or teammates have dropped in the buy zone.<br/><br/><video autoplay="" height="auto" loop="" playsinline="" poster="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/f1462b7eefe16c70d61291b8676b1a404688da37.png?origin=" width="100%"><source src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/e14db7419e60d31e09ed7d199683561d061bbc17.mp4?origin=" type="video/mp4"/><source src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/ce366b2eaaf9211f367b50eec46533f8f99ba207.webm?origin=" type="video/webm"/></video><br/>There are several more HUD/UI changes in today's update. For those of you who have memorized a library of grenade line-ups, a line-up reticle will appear shortly after you pull the pin (you can even customize the delay for each grenade type). And if you've had trouble navigating through smoke, set a Radar Map Alternate Zoom and add a Toggle Radar Zoom key binding, which will let you switch between zoom levels during a round.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/ac9e7e5f1f6386cfec4de86e771a6fdc7206471c.png"/><br/>We've updated the Active Duty map pool (for both Premier and competitions), removing Overpass and bringing back Dust II. And there are changes to many other maps, including significant changes to Inferno.<br/><br/>Jump right into a match and see what's new, or practice with your friends--practice matches and workshop maps can now be launched with members of your party.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/3644028846252008595?l=english</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Today we’re updating the CS2 Limited Test with a new map (Inferno!) and the all new CS Rating. <br/><br/>Your CS Rating is a visible measurement of your Counter-Strike performance, and it will determine where you stand on global and regional leaderboards. To get your CS Rating, play matches in the updated Premier mode (our Active Duty Pick-Ban competitive mode) either on your own or with your friends.<br/><br/><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="748" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6BNHro0vSg;full" style="width: 748px; height: 420px;" width="748"></iframe><br/><br/>Additionally, today we’re starting the process of inviting as many eligible players as possible to the Limited Test. To be eligible for a CS2 Limited Test invite players must have CS:GO Prime status, an active official competitive matchmaking Skill Group, and play majority of their official matchmaking games in one of the regions where the Limited Test is available.<br/><br/><div class="bbcodes_Header3_2q6Vr BB_Header3">Saving Time</div>Over the past decade, we’ve shipped updates to the economy and weapon balance to trim the fat and reduce the number of uncontested rounds in a match of CS.<br/><br/>Because of these changes, exciting competitive matches can be resolved with fewer rounds. And shorter matches mean players can play more, and more often. So with CS2, we’re moving to a maximum of 24 rounds in regulation time (with a 6 round overtime in case of a tie) for Premier, Competitive, and the Majors.<br/><br/>We expect the structure and flow of matches to evolve over time as the community adapts. And we’re excited to see where they go next.<br/>]]></description>

      <title>A Level Playing Field</title>
      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/3677802763035982969?l=english</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Counter-Strike is at its best when teams compete on a level playing field and when ability is the only limit to their success. <br/><br/>Over the past few years, we’ve seen professional Counter-Strike drift away from that ideal. The ecosystem has become gradually less open, with access to the highest levels of competition increasingly gated by business relationships. <br/><br/>We think that Counter-Strike should be an open sport. So we’re going to add new requirements to running large-scale competitive events. The finer details are still in progress, but here are the broad strokes:<br/><ul class="bbcodes_List_20uQh"><li class="bbcodes_ListItem_1BF9I"> Tournament organizers will no longer have unique business relationships or other conflicts of interest with teams that participate in their events. <br/><br/></li><li class="bbcodes_ListItem_1BF9I"> Invitations to all tournaments will use our ranking system (detailed <a class="Focusable" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FValveSoftware%2Fcounter-strike%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fregional_standings" rel="noopener nofollow" tabindex="0"><span data-tooltip-text="github.com">here</span></a>), or otherwise be determined by open qualifiers. <br/><br/></li><li class="bbcodes_ListItem_1BF9I"> Any compensation for participating teams—prize pool or otherwise—will be made public and will be driven by objective criteria that can be inspected by the community. <br/></li></ul>Since tournament organizers have existing long term commitments, these requirements will take effect as of 2025. There will be some rough edges to the transition, but we’re committed to the long-term health of Counter-Strike as a sport and are looking forward to its bright and open future.<br/>]]></description>
