      <title>Season Two: Episode One</title>
      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/529852487375519751</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images//3381077/f780ca0f8f1f5561b4f72030672ed657382ecd9a.png"/><br />Premier Season Three begins today!<br /><br />It&#39;s time to start working toward your Season Three Medal. As before, the color of your medal will correspond to the highest CS Rating achieved during the season, and the bars will reflect your total wins, with one bar for every 25 (up to five bars). To be eligible for a medal, you&#39;ll need an account in good standing, 25 Premier match wins, and an active CSR at the end of the season.<br /><br /><h3>New for Season 3 </h3><br />With the new season comes an update to the Active Duty Map Pool: Overpass is back in, and Anubis is out.<br /><br />There are a few gameplay changes with Season Three. Fire from the incendiary grenade now spreads faster, occupying space rapidly to counter rushing Ts. The MP9 has gotten a bit of a nerf, with a harder to control spray and substantially less jumping accuracy. There&#39;s also a change to the CT economy: win or lose, CTs now receive a shared team award for each T eliminated in the round, so the more you win and the closer you keep your losses, the more you&#39;ll have to spend.<br /><br /><h3>Trade Protected Items</h3><br />Today we are introducing a new feature to help keep your Counter-Strike items secure. In the unlikely event that you lose control of your account or were the target of a scam by a bad actor, you may reverse all Counter-Strike item trades from the last 7 days. <br /><br />Obviously we hope you&#39;ll never need it, but you can review your recent trades and find the trade reversal feature on the Trade History page on your Steam Account. For more information about what happens when trades are reversed, visit the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/365F-4BEE-2AE2-7BDD">FAQ</a>]]></description>

      <title>Champions of Shanghai</title>
      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/529833471389991079</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/c832bcc989b6e03012fde727c077c846d245cb22.jpg"/><br />The Perfect World Shanghai Grand Final was one to remember. Team Spirit and FaZe Clan needed all three maps to determine a champion in front of an excited, sold-out crowd at the SPD Bank Oriental Sports Center.<br /><br />Down 12:5 on map 3, FaZe Clan battled back with 6 consecutive round wins—and some incredible clutches along the way—to force round 24. With the bomb planted and down to a 1v1, sh1ro&#39;s final kill earned Team Spirit their first Major Championship.<br /><br />Celebrate Team Spirit&#39;s win with the Major Champions Capsule, now available for purchase. The capsule features autographs from Team Spirit in paper, glitter, holo, and gold, and 50% of the proceeds go to the players and organizations.<br /><br /><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/3ed2c31143f07013ef30373c1458adc84731c04d.png"/><br />With Shanghai in the books we look forward to the BLAST.tv Major in Austin, Texas. See you in June 2025!<br /><br /><h3>2025 Service Medal</h3><br /><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/7f0747f83da9da8ed752f3848e0ab17caf40de9d.png"/><br />Beginning January 1st, 2025 players can receive the newest Service Medal in-game. <br /><br />When you reach Global General (Rank 40) you&#39;ll have the option to reset your Profile Rank and earn (or upgrade) a 2025 Service Medal.<br /><br />Good luck and have fun!]]></description>

      <title>Side-stepping Skill</title>
      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/6500469346429600836</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Counter-Strike is constantly evolving. From art, to maps, to inventive plays, and even player input, the CS community shapes the game. <br /><br />Scripting and automating player commands has always been contentious, but over the years some forms of scripting (e.g., jump-throws) have gained acceptance, as they enable plays that wouldn&#39;t otherwise be possible. In fact, jump-throws became such an important part of the game that we&#39;ve done the work to make them reliable without any special scripting or binds (i.e., by jumping and quickly throwing a grenade).<br /><br />Developing one&#39;s coordination and reaction time has always been key to mastering Counter-Strike.<br /><br />Recently, some hardware features have blurred the line between manual input and automation, so we&#39;ve decided to draw a clear line on what is or isn&#39;t acceptable in Counter-Strike.<br /><br />We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially&ndash;exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match.<br /><br />To prevent accidental infractions, in-game binds that include more than one movement and/or attack actions will no longer work (e.g., null-binds and jump-throw binds).<br /><br />If you have a keyboard that includes an input-automation feature (e.g., &quot;Snap Tap Mode&quot;), be sure to disable the feature before you join a match in order to avoid any interruption to your matches.]]></description>
